- LeBlanc's law: _"Later equals never."_

Ch 2. - Meaningful Names
------------------------
- The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope
- Don't be cute
- Pick one word per concept
- Default to _solution_ domain names, then to _problem_ domain names
  - i.e. programmers read your code, so speak to them
- Don't add gratuitous context
